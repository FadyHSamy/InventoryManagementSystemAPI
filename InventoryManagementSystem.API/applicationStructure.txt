Brief Description of Each Folder
API Project (InventoryManagementSystem.API):

Configuration: Handles configuration files specific to the API layer, like middleware settings, routing, or Swagger setup.
Controllers: Contains the API controllers that manage endpoints, handle incoming requests, and return responses.
DTOs: Data Transfer Objects define the contract for the API, specifying the structure of the data sent and received.
Models: API-specific models, typically used for input/output representations distinct from domain models.
Application Project (InventoryManagementSystem.Application):

Mappers: Defines mapping logic to convert between entities and DTOs, usually leveraging libraries like AutoMapper.
Services: Contains business logic that handles the application’s operations and interacts with the domain entities.
Interfaces: Defines contracts for application services, facilitating dependency injection and abstraction of business logic.
UseCases: Represents the specific business use cases of the application, encapsulating business rules and workflows.
Validators: Validation logic for incoming data (DTOs), ensuring correctness before processing business rules.
Core Project (InventoryManagementSystem.Core):

Configuration: Core configuration classes that define settings used across the domain, like constants or shared configuration data.
Entities: Domain entities representing the core business models (e.g., User, Product), reflecting the structure of data in your domain.
Exceptions: Custom exceptions related to the domain logic, enabling specific error handling and control flow.
Interfaces: Core interfaces, such as repository contracts or domain services, abstracting the implementation details of the domain layer.
Specifications: Implements the specification pattern, defining complex query logic or business rules that can be applied to entities.
Infrastructure Project (InventoryManagementSystem.Infrastructure):

Context: Manages database context classes, responsible for connecting to the database (e.g., through Dapper).
Data: Contains the implementations of repositories defined in the Core, interacting directly with the database.
Extensions: Provides extension methods that simplify infrastructure tasks, like registering services in the dependency injection container.
Services: Infrastructure-related service implementations, such as file storage, logging, or external API calls.
